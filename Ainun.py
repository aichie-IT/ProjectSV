        **Summary:** The dataset is composed of 101 participants, which is an sample to see the significant trends in the mental health 
        of students and their internet use. The survey is dominated by female who form majority of the respondents meaning that the female 
        students are more represented in the survey. Regarding the level of study, Year 4 students are the majority group which implies that 
        final-year students are the most represented and can have different academic and mental health issues as compared to the lower years.
